My Library Savings uses the amount it would take the library to replace library materials you check out to calculate how much you save using the library. When an exact replacement price cannot be determined, the library will use the average price of a similar item. You must have [Reading History](/MyAccount/ReadingHistory) enabled to see Library Savings for items you have returned to the library. If you do not wish to see your savings from the library, you can opt out of Library Savings below or from your preferences.
