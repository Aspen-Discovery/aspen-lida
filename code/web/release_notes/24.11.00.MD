## Aspen LiDA Updates
- Show home library name of linked accounts on Library Card page. Only show the library logo if it's correct for the home library. (Ticket 128681) (*KP*)  
- Fixed a bug where holds needing confirmation were causing the app to crash. (Ticket 139245) (*KK*)
- Fixed a bug where Koha was returning a 400 error when placing a hold. (Ticket 137232) (*KK*)
- Added Self Registration to the Login screen. (*KK*)
- To comply with the app store rules when enabling self registration users can now delete their Aspen Discovery account within Aspen LiDA in the 'More' menu. This only deletes user data related to Aspen Discovery such as lists, searches, cached holds/checkouts, etc. and does not affect their account with the ILS. (*KK*)

## Aspen Discovery Updates

### Admin Updates
- Create a new Background Process that will allow long-running tasks to be executed in the background. This is currently used for generating reading history for test users, and recalculating cost savings. When executed, a user message is displayed when the task finishes so the user can do other tasks while the process runs. When results of the process are viewed, the message is automatically cleared. (*MDN*)

- Add a new format for Zines based on the 655a (*MDN*)
- Update indexer to avoid errors during concurrent (multithreaded) indexing of materials. (*MDN*)

### Install Updates
- Make it easier to create new Symphony sites by creating account profiles and indexing profiles (similar to how Koha sites can be set up). (*MDN*)

### Library Savings
- Update recalculating library cost savings from the Replacement Costs page to be done in the background to support libraries which have a large number of patrons with reading history. (*MDN*)

### Materials Request Updates
- Correct updating the internal formatId of requests when a request is created or updated. (*MDN*)
- Update hold candidate generation log to sort newest to oldest. (*MDN*)

### OverDrive Updates
- Allow a single library to access multiple OverDrive collections. (DIS-29) (*MDN*)
  - Split the information within OverDrive Scopes into:
    - Scopes which define the records to include for a library (Adult, Teen, Kids) 
    - Library Settings which define the information about how to connect to the OverDrive collection which does not change based on the records included 
  - Allow multiple OverDrive Settings to be attached to a single library. 
  - When loading information from OverDrive about the records that are owned by a library, add an item for each collection that provides the title.
  - If a library has access to more than one OverDrive collection, add a "Where is it?" link to search results and full record views. 
  - When selecting the "Where is it?" link, Aspen will display a list of owning collections with the total number of copies, available copies, and number of holds.
  - Within the Copies section of full record view, display the number of holds on each collection for each copy. 
  - Display information about what collection a title is from within Holds and Checkouts if the library has access to more than one collection. 
  - When placing a hold or checking out a title, determine the best collection to place the hold in or borrow the title from. This takes into account whether the patron has remaining checkouts and/or holds, the availability of the title within each collection, and the hold ratio of titles in each collection if the title is not available. 
  - When freezing holds, thawing holds, returning titles, and accessing titles, ensure that the credentials for the proper collection are used.
  - Allow patrons to view and modify the default loan periods for each collection.
  - Update API data page to properly handle multiple OverDrive collections for a library. 
  - Display additional information on the Aspen Data page to more easily see the information stored in the database about each title and the collections it belongs in. 
- Rename the old Format section to Available Platforms within the OverDrive full record page to meet OverDrive implementation standards. (*MDN*)
- When displaying format information, drop references to EPUB, PDF, etc. and use preferred terminology of Libby eBook, Libby eAudiobook. Where Libby will be automatically renamed with the reader name defined in settings. (*MDN*)  
- Remove the old fulfillment interface that was deprecated by OverDrive. Fulfillment will be done using the new iFrame method. (*MDN*)
- Simplify loading number of copies owned, number of copies checked out, and number of holds for records within each collection. (*MDN*)
- Allow naming the OverDrive platform within settings, so it can be used independently of the reader name. (DIS-29) (*MDN*)
- Clean up usage of the OverDrive reader name to properly separate the reader name from the OverDrive platform. (DIS-29) (*MDN*)
- Fix spacing after reader name within the account menu so the count of titles on hold or checked out is not directly after the label. (*MDN*)
- Add handling within staff view if an OverDrive record is not attached to a Grouped Work and does not have bookcover information. (*MDN*)
- Remove unused code within OverDrive indexer. (*MDN*)
